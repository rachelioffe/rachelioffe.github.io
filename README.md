Hello my love!

I figured out how to make these websites! This is my first one ever. How cool!

I thought maybe you would appreciate one made for you by me :)

For this letter, you said its contents would be up to me. I think we are really good at expressing our love and appreciation for each other but Ive been in a reflective
mood recently and since ive spent the entirety of this last semester with you, a lot of my thoughts have been about you.

I just want to re-iterate how amazing of a person I think you are. Honestly, ive never met someone as kind, and smart, and loving as you. I achieved a lot this semester in terms of my school work, and research goals, and even my physical health has improved all with you by my side. Ive learned a lot from you about how to manage time,
interpersonal relationships, and youve even revived a sense of hope and excitement in me for the future. To think that ive reaped all these benefits from meeting you and spending just over 3 months of my life with you. 

I think its so cool how I can learn so much from you and thinking of the possible future we can have together makes me so excited and happy! 

However, thinking about the future also fills me with a sense of fear. You've honestly given me such a good time... the thought of losing you would hurt so much. And i know you say that you wouldn't replace me with someone else and we can visit each other and call each other and everything will all be okay. But a part of me is scared that having a relationship over the phone won't feel like a real relationship. 

I know this is a real downer, but the prospect of a future with you honestly makes me think I can wait for you for years and years. Even if we only manage to spend a minute talking to each other each day. The fact that in just 2 years, I could start a life with you makes all this seem worth it. I hope my feelings dont come off to strong. But in reality, they are! 

I love you so incredibly much. 

I should end things off on a brighter note. 

I think you'll be receiving this while I'm in the Netherlands.
